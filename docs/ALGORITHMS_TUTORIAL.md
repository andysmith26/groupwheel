# Choosing a Grouping Option (Tutorial)

This guide explains, in plain language, how the candidate options are created.
Each option uses a different "style" of grouping so you can compare trade-offs.

## Why multiple algorithms?

No single grouping strategy is perfect for every class. The gallery gives you a mix so you can quickly scan and choose the option that fits your goals for the day.

## The six styles you will see

### Balanced

- Tries to create groups that are fair and well-rounded.
- Uses student preferences when possible, but keeps group sizes even.
- Good default if you want a reliable, all-around choice.

### Random Shuffle

- Groups students randomly.
- Useful when you want a neutral baseline with no bias.
- Great for quick variety or when preferences are not important.

### Round Robin

- Distributes students evenly by cycling through groups.
- Keeps group sizes very consistent.
- Helpful when you mainly care about size balance and even distribution.

### Preference-First

- Tries to place each student into their top requested group.
- Maximizes first-choice satisfaction.
- May sacrifice balance or overall fairness to honor preferences.

### Simulated Annealing

- Starts with a grouping and makes lots of small swaps.
- Keeps changes that improve the overall fit, sometimes accepts small setbacks to explore.
- Think of it like rearranging seats bit by bit until the room feels better overall.

### Genetic Algorithm

- Creates several groupings, keeps the best, and combines them over a few rounds.
- Searches for stronger combinations by mixing \"good parts\" of different options.
- Think of it like trying a few lineups and remixing the strongest into better teams.

## How to use the gallery

1. Scan the options and their metrics (Top Choice %, Average Rank, and group size mix).
2. Click the option that best matches your goal today.
3. You can edit the chosen option immediately.

## Switching after you start editing

If you go back to the gallery later, you can pick a new option. A warning will appear because the app will replace your current edits with the newly selected option.

## Tips

- If you want fairness and stability, start with Balanced.
- If you want to honor student requests, try Preference-First.
- If you want variety or a clean slate, use Random Shuffle or Round Robin.
